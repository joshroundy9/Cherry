# Cherry
Cherry is a meal tracking app designed to make it easy
to track your weekly, monthly, and yearly average calorie intakes. 
This allows its users to more accurately make dietary adjustments
and lose weight.
## Backend
Cherry's backend is made with a Spring Boot authentication and data API
that connects with a Microsoft SQL Server database. While developing it, I
heavily focused on testing to make sure that everything worked
properly which made it easier to bug fix and work faster.
## Frontend
Cherry's front end consists of a React JS web app that makes HTTP requests
to the back end getting the authorization and data it needs to operate.
## Conclusion
Cherry is my first fully functional full stack app which I developed using 
a lot of the knowledge gained from my software engineering internship at USAA.
